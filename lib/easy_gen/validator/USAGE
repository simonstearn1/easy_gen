Description:
  Lays out a new service object under /app/decorators, with a test file under /test/decorators.
  The service class will inherit from /app/decorators/application_decorator class which will be created.
  if you use the generator to delete decorator classes, these will be removed together with directories once
  the count of non abstract classes == 0.

Example:
    `rails generate decorator Mydecorator`

    This will create:
        app/decorators/application_decorator.rb
        app/decorators/my_decorator.rb
        test/decorators/my_decorator_test.rb
