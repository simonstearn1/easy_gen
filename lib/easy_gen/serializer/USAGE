Description:
  Lays out a new serializers object under /app/serializers, with a test file under /test/serializers.
  The null value class will inherit from /app/serializers/application_serializer.rb class which will be created.
  if you use the generator to delete null classes, these will be removed together with directories once
  the count of non abstract classes == 0.

Example:
    `rails generate serializer MySerializer`

    This will create:
        app/serializers/application_serializer.rb
        app/serializers/my_serializer.rb
        test/serializers/my_serializer_test.rb
