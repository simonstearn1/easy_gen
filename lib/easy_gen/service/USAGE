Description:
  Lays out a new service object under /app/services, with a test file under /test/services.
  The service class will inherit from /app/service/application_service class which will be created.
  if you use the generator to delete service classes, these will be removed together with directories once
  the count of non abstract classes == 0.

Example:
    `rails generate service MyService`

    This will create:
        app/services/application_service.rb
        app/services/my_service.rb
        test/services/my_service_test.rb
